    <h1>Our Motivation for developing CAS</h1>
    <header>
    <p>As we have seen all the works going on in our college, we observed that faculty find it extremely difficult to do it manually. <br>Especially, when some mistakes are identified in the work, they must check the whole work to find the faults. <br>And, a lot of paperwork has been done, which consumes a lot of our valuable time.<br><br><br>
    
    To overcome these problems, we have developed the College Administrative System (CAS), where all the work has been made easier. <br>This system includes all the major components of the College Administration such as admissions, marks, timetables & attendance, exam schedules, invigilation & remunerations, alumni, etc.,<br> Using this system, most of the work can be done easily.<br><br><br>
    
    Now, we have also extended some additional functionalities like result analysis, feedback, fee and Course file.<br> These are the most difficult tasks that take a lot of time and paperwork. <br>The developed system will make these works easier.</p>
